              <p>
                Windsurf provides the project workspace where files live, while Cascade extends
                that workspace with conversational problem-solving. Understanding how the two
                layers interact keeps your AI teammate aligned with the code you are actively
                shaping.

                  <p>
                    Each Windsurf project maps to a folder on disk. The IDE mirrors your
                    repository tree, tracks open editors, and highlights file changes in real
                    time.

                  <p>
                    Cascade conversations sit alongside the workspace. Each thread retains the
                    code, diffs, and rules you surface during the session, so you can iterate
                    without repeating setup steps.

                <p>
                  Cascade can answer general questions from the internet or its own knowledge,
                  but its code-aware help is grounded in the Windsurf workspace you have open.
                  Keeping that mapping clear helps avoid mixing context between projects.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Open the correct folder in Windsurf before asking Cascade about code. Its
                    structured file access is scoped to the current project path, not your whole
                    machine.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When you want edits, anchor prompts to specific files or snippets that are
                    open or recently edited so Cascade can propose precise diffs instead of
                    guessing where changes belong.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When you switch repositories, open a new Windsurf workspace and start a fresh
                    Cascade conversation. This keeps each thread focused and prevents historical
                    context from one project leaking into another.

                    <strong>Tip:</strong> Ask Cascade general questions (for example, about Git or
                    AI concepts) in any conversation, but when you want it to change code, mention
                    the specific file or snippet in your open workspace so that its proposals line
                    up with your repository layout.

                <p>
                  A project often lives for months or years, but an individual Cascade conversation
                  is usually scoped to a narrower slice of that work&mdash;a feature, a bug, or a short
                  learning goal. Treat conversations as chapters inside the longer story of your
                  project.

                      Your Windsurf workspace can stay open for the entire life of a repository
                      (weeks or months). Files, history, and tooling evolve, but the project

                      create a dedicated conversation so its history mirrors that task.

                      conversation with a short summary of where the project stands.

                    A typical Plan section might show something like:

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>9,552.5 credits left</strong> &mdash; headline total currently available.</li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>1,000 / 1,000 prompt credits left</strong> &mdash; your personal
                      Cascade allocation for this billing period, with the numerator showing what
                      you have left and the denominator showing the full allowance.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>8,552.5 add-on credits available</strong> &mdash; a shared pool of

                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    In this example, your personal bucket is full, and there is also a sizeable
                    enterprise pool that everyone can draw from when allowed.

                  <p>
                    It helps to separate credits into two buckets when you are planning your work
                    in Windsurf:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Personal prompt credits</strong> are tied to your individual account
                      and typically reset on a fixed schedule. Use these for day-to-day coding
                      help, learning, and exploratory work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Add-on (enterprise) credits</strong> belong to your organization and
                      are shared across many users. Teams often reserve this pool for
                      higher-priority efforts such as client deliverables, production incidents,
                      or critical internal initiatives.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    When your personal credits reach zero, any continued usage may start to draw
                    from the enterprise pool, depending on how your organization has configured
                    access.

                  <p>
                    Model names often combine a base line with hints about their strengths. For
                    example names like these follow common patterns:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>GPT-5 (high reasoning)</strong> &mdash; same core family as other
                      GPT-5 models, but configured to spend more compute on deep reasoning and
                      planning. Good for tricky bugs, architecture reviews, and complex analysis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>GPT-5 (low reasoning)</strong> &mdash; optimized for speed and lower
                      cost. Best for straightforward questions, simple refactors, or quick
                      clarifications.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>GPT-5-Codex</strong> &mdash; a variant tuned specifically for code.
                      Prefer this when your prompt is mostly code, tests, or refactoring requests
                      in a supported language.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>GPT-5.1-Codex-Mini</strong> &mdash; a smaller, faster code model. A
                      good default for iterative development where you want low latency and are
                      comfortable reviewing and correcting the results.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    Other series such as Claude or Sonnet follow similar ideas: larger versions for
                    quality and reasoning, smaller ones for speed and cost, and special variants
                    focused on code or other tasks.

                  <h4>Using cost and labels to choose</h4>
                  <p>
                    Each model entry also includes a <strong>cost indicator</strong> such as
                    <code>Free</code>, <code>0.5x</code>, <code>1x</code>, <code>2x</code>, or
                    <code>3x</code>. This tells you how many credits that model uses relative to a
                    baseline model:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Free</strong> &mdash; does not consume paid credits while free usage is available.</li>
                    <li><strong>0.5x</strong> &mdash; about half the cost of a 1x baseline model for the same prompt size.</li>
                    <li><strong>2x, 3x</strong> &mdash; two or three times the baseline cost, in exchange for higher quality, better reasoning, or both.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    A simple rule of thumb for beginners is:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Start with a <strong>1x general or code model</strong> for most work.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Drop to a <strong>0.5x or mini</strong> option for quick, low-stakes
                      questions when you want to conserve credits.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Switch to a <strong>2x or 3x reasoning model</strong> when you are stuck on a
                      difficult problem and expect better reasoning to save you more time than the
                      extra credits cost.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                <h4>Switching models within one conversation</h4>
                <p>
                  You are not locked into a single model for the life of a conversation. In most
                  Cascade workflows, the model you pick in the dropdown applies to the next
                  message, while the conversation history remains the same.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Use a <strong>cheaper or mini model</strong> early on to explore the problem,
                    gather context, and try quick ideas.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When you reach a hard question or a critical decision, switch to a
                    <strong>higher reasoning</strong> or <strong>larger code model</strong> for a
                    few key prompts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    After the heavy lifting is done, you can return to a faster model for follow-up
                    questions and small tweaks, without starting a new conversation.
