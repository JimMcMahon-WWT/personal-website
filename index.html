              <p>
                Windsurf provides the project workspace where files live, while Cascade extends
                that workspace with conversational problem-solving. Understanding how the two
                layers interact keeps your AI teammate aligned with the code you are actively
                shaping.

                  <p>
                    Each Windsurf project maps to a folder on disk. The IDE mirrors your
                    repository tree, tracks open editors, and highlights file changes in real
                    time.

                    <li>
                      Use the file explorer to stage what Cascade should reference—open files are
                      prioritized when the assistant composes responses.

                  <p>
                    Cascade conversations sit alongside the workspace. Each thread retains the
                    code, diffs, and rules you surface during the session, so you can iterate
                    without repeating setup steps.

                      Cascade’s context window.

                <h4>How the workspace and conversations connect</h4>
                <p>
                  Cascade can answer general questions from the internet or its own knowledge,
                  but its code-aware help is grounded in the Windsurf workspace you have open.
                  Keeping that mapping clear helps avoid mixing context between projects.
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Open the correct folder in Windsurf before asking Cascade about code. Its
                    structured file access is scoped to the current project path, not your whole
                    machine.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When you want edits, anchor prompts to specific files or snippets that are
                    open or recently edited so Cascade can propose precise diffs instead of
                    guessing where changes belong.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When you switch repositories, open a new Windsurf workspace and start a fresh
                    Cascade conversation. This keeps each thread focused and prevents historical
                    context from one project leaking into another.
                  </li>
                </ol>

                  <p>
                    <strong>Tip:</strong> Ask Cascade general questions (for example, about Git or
                    AI concepts) in any conversation, but when you want it to change code, mention
                    the specific file or snippet in your open workspace so that its proposals line
                    up with your repository layout.

                <h3>Project Life Cycle vs Conversation Life Cycle</h3>
                <p>
                  A project often lives for months or years, but an individual Cascade conversation
                  is usually scoped to a narrower slice of that work&mdash;a feature, a bug, or a short
                  learning goal. Treat conversations as chapters inside the longer story of your
                  project.

                    <p>
                      Your Windsurf workspace can stay open for the entire life of a repository
                      (weeks or months). Files, history, and tooling evolve, but the project
                      identity stays the same.

                        documentation across many releases.

                    <p>
                      Cascade conversations are best kept focused. A single thread might follow
                      one feature, bug fix, or experiment over a few hours or days.

                        Reuse a conversation while you are actively iterating on the same story,

                    <li>
                      <strong>New feature or story:</strong> When you begin work on a distinct
                      feature or user story (for example, "add search to the knowledge base"),
                      create a dedicated conversation so its history mirrors that task.

                    <li>
                      <strong>Context reset:</strong> If a thread has become long and meandering,
                      or you have switched to an unrelated area of the codebase, start a fresh
                      conversation with a short summary of where the project stands.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Long-running maintenance:</strong> Over months of supporting the
                      same project, expect to open many conversationsfor incidents, refactors,
                      and experimentswhile keeping the same Windsurf workspace.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Short, intense bursts:</strong> If you are focused on a single bug or
                      story for a few days, it is usually helpful to keep one conversation open for
                      that entire burst so Cascade can build up a rich, task-specific memory.
