# AI Workflow Playbook

A personal knowledge base for documenting lessons learned while adopting AI pair programmers like Windsurf and Cascade. The project focuses on beginner-friendly guidance for prompt credit management, model selection, prompt design, rules, and MCP usage.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Static page skeleton outlining each learning area.
- `styles.css` – Styling for the modern, glassmorphism-inspired layout.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in your browser (e.g., `file:///c:/Users/mcmahonj/CascadeProjects/personal-website/index.html`).
2. Start filling in each section with notes, checklists, and examples from your AI workflows.

## Next Steps

- Populate each placeholder with real content (templates, charts, case studies).
- Add tooling (static site generator, build scripts) if you want to evolve beyond a static prototype.
- Commit changes and configure remote hosting when ready.
